This is the home for Project Darkmantle. Darkmantle is an extension of the
Shadowcraft Engine project started by Aldriana, except it uses an intricate
iterative preorder tree traversal system to calculate possible outcomes.

This is an extremely precise, but slow, algorithm approach.

If you are looking for Shadowcraft code, the most recent (as of writing this)
repository is https://github.com/dazer/ShadowCraft-Engine. You will not find
updates to the Shadowcraft Engine here, only Darkmantle stuff.
